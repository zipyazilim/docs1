            <h2>SQL Export</h2>
            <p>After completing your project, you should output it to the database. We recommend Railway or Planetscale for this. Railway was used in this project. If you don't know how to install Railway on your computer, have a simple look at <a href="https://docs.railway.app/" target="_blank">Railway Docs</a>. Install it with Terminal and send a db push after making database settings from the .env file. Now you are ready!</p>
